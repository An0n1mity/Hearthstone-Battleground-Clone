## Design pattern
The goal of this project was to try learn basic of design pattern for OOP using C++.  
1. Uses of smart pointers : Better aggregation and composition relationship than with raw pointers.
2. Abstract classes : Polymorphism, Interfaces, Generics.
3. Factory pattern : Create cards in a flexible and modular way.

## Gameplay ðŸŽ®
Turn based game consisting of two phases : *recruitement* and *battle*.  
The game end when one of the player has lost all of his HP.  
* **RECRUITEMENT** :

* **BATTLE** :
  First player with most cards start the attack, minions attacking goes from left to right order and target a random enemy.
## Card effects ðŸª„
